          We believe the internet is for everyone. However, there are many groups who find
          themselves excluded from accessing the web. Our mission is to use our skills and abilities
          to build tools that help make the internet a more accessible place.

            Team Equa11y is all about sharing our passion for web accessibility. If you check out
            our transitions page, you can take a tour of common accessibility errors found on many
            websites. If you visit our docs link, we'll share some great resources with you and
            connect you to some really helpful development tools that can assist you in making your
            applications accessible to most.

          <h2>Why is accessibility important?</h2>
          <p>
            It is estimated that 15% of the worldâ€™s population experiences some form of disability.
            Without accessibility considerations, only 85% of users will be able to access your
            website. Keeping accessibility features in mind during the development process will
            allow those who use assistive technology to access the internet or have visual/hearing
            impairments to use your website.
